# Intelligent-Vehicle-STM32
Based on Microprocessor STM32F407ZET6.
This experiment mainly analyzes the control system of smart car based on microprocessor STM32F407ZET6 system design process. The composition of the intelligent system mainly including STM32F407ZET6 controller, motor drive circuit, circuit of ultrasonic obstacle avoidance. This experiment adopts STM32F407ZET6 microprocessor as the core chip, using PWM technique to control speed and steering gear steering, obstacle avoidance module for obstacle detection and obstacle avoidance function, other peripheral extended circuit to realize the whole system function. When the car is moving, obstacle avoidance program prior to tracking, using ultrasonic ranging and obstacle avoidance obstacle avoidance circuit, we use steering gear under ultrasonic module to control the emission direction of ultrasonic, infrared detection circuit is used to implement the car tracking function. On the basis of the hardware design is proposed for motor control function, simple intelligent car tracking and obstacle avoidance function of software design, and in the STM32 integrated development environment under the Keil uVision5. Write the corresponding control program, and use JLink program download software.
